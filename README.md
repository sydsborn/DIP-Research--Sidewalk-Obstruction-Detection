<h1> Sidewalk Obstruction Detection using Pre-Trained ResNet-50 Model </h1>
<h3> This repo contains all the files used for our DIP research project during our midyear term at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. By using images of streets in Intramuros, Manila, we were able to create a model that is capable of detecting sidewalk obstructions commonly found in the Philippines, specifically Metro Manila. </h3>

<p> This project relies heavily on <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2"> Detectron2 </a> for model training and
  testing, as well as its possible future deployment. </p>
<p> Dataset images were acquired using Google Street View of some of the streets of intramuros. To maximize the sidewalk capture, the view was configured to show a 1-point perspective of the street, and then manually saved by printing the page or by using Windows' snipping tool.
